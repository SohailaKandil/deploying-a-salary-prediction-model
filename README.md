# deploying-a-salary-prediction-model
In this project, I built a salary prediction model using linear regression and deployed it with Flask.

First, we cleaned the data by removing all null values. Next, we conducted data analysis to understand the relationship between each factor and the salary. Factors that showed no correlation with salary were removed.

We then built and trained a linear regression model using scikit-learn (SKlearn).

Finally, we deployed our model on a web browser using Flask.
